# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° ConflictWatch: India-Pakistan Escalation â€“ May 2025

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs a geospatial and temporal analysis of reported conflict events between India and Pakistan during May 2025. The data includes multiple event types, casualty figures, and coordinates, curated from publicly available news and reporting sources.

---

## Features of the Analysis

- **Data Cleaning & Structuring**: Processes raw event data for spatial and temporal aggregation.
- **Macro vs Micro Location Mapping**: Differentiates general areas (e.g., cities) and pinpoint sites (e.g., mosques).
- **Casualty Summarization**: Groups and visualizes civilian and non-civilian impact.
- **Time Trend Analysis**: Visualizes escalation patterns and high-intensity days.
- **Folium Maps**: Interactive geospatial maps showing event severity.
- **Insightful Commentary**: Each step includes context and interpretations to support understanding and further use.

## Limitations

- The dataset is a **snapshot of an evolving conflict**, and not all events may be fully validated.
- Source information is compiled from multiple public platforms, and some discrepancies may exist.
- This notebook is intended for exploratory and research purposes.

---

## Next Steps

- Integrate event-type-level filtering (e.g., airstrike vs reconnaissance)
- Incorporate sentiment or credibility scoring of sources
- Automate data ingestion from RSS feeds or APIs
- Create a dashboard or public visualization site
